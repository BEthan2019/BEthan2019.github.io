      <h2 style="border-style: ridge; border-color: darkorange ;color=rgb(0, 139, 0, 1)"> What Does <i>Sustaining and Preserving</i> our Environment Acutally Mean?</h2>
      <p>We all know that the world is advancing rapidly, however, with the sudden advancement of human technology, often times the environment can find itself an unfortuante victim of advances made in technology and engineering. That is why sustaining and preserving our environment is so important. Sustaining and preserving our environment is defined by efforts to preserve natural ecosystems and protect wildlife in their natural habitats. We can tie it back to a saying 'think globally, act locally'. Essentially, we can help our environment together if we help in our local communities. The major way to act locally to help the environment is by controlling our plastic waste. People in the US generate on average around <a href=" https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/11/11/which-two-countries-produce-the-most-plastic-trash-per-person/?sh=642fb9397187">105kg (231lbs) per year</a>. Plastic waste can easily be decreased if we folow the three simple steps: <b>Reuse, Reduce, Recycle!</b></p>

      <h3><span id="border" style="border-bottom-style: solid"> Reusing! </span></h3>
      <p>The steps explain themselves. Find ways to reuse plastic items, or purchase reusable plastic containers (optimally BPA-free biodegradable). If you fall into a creative pitfall, you can easily search up DIY projects on how to reuse plastic items! This <a href="https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/diy-plastic-bottles-recycling/">article</a> shows countless fun projects using simple plastic items.  </p>

      <h3> <span id="border" style="border-bottom-style: solid"> Reducing! </span></h3>
      <p>If you find yourself buying more plastic goods than you use, then assess your priorties and ask yourself, "Do I need this?" Often times, we underestimate the longetivty and value of one plastic product, so we end up buying more than we need. So as a rule of thumb, ask yourself if you have enought plastic goods at home before buying one.</p>
      <h3> <span id="border" style="border-bottom-style: solid"> Recycling! </span></h3>
      <p>This step is probably the most well known, but least enacted. Out of the nearly 300 million tons of municipal solid waste produced in 2018, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture">only 69 million tons were recyled</a>.  Recycling is the act of taking products that can be utilized in other items and using the recycled item to create a new product. This cuts down on waste by using products that would have been disposed of and instead putting them to another use. For thoses that do not want to repurpose their plastic goods, you can recycle them by either bringing recyclable goods to a local bottle recycle center or seperate your waste from nonrecyclables from recyclables.

      <h3> <span id="border" style="border-bottom-style: solid"> The Bottom Line! </span></h3>
      <p> All in all, just be wary of how many plastic products you own, use, and dispose of. Plastic waste will become a large issue in the future unless we all act together to prevent further waste. Just simply remember: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!</p>
      
      <span style="border-style: solid; padding : 3px"> Play our game, <i>Plastic Invaders</i>!</span>
      <p id="margin">A game inspired by the classic <i>Space Invaders,</i> Plastic Invaders is designed so that the player must destroy the detrimental non-biodegradable BPA plastics before it reaches Earth! And for every bottle you destroy, one ton of recyclable plastics are repurposed into bottles, containers, and the alike! (not really, but hopefully this game will get you in the mood of preserving our environment) </p>
